## 多数的健身建议都是误导

本指南是一年以来我通过现代科学能够证明的最有效的肌肉锻炼方法，它适用于任何性别的人。

我写这个指南是因为即使是在 2016 年，许多非正式的健身建议都是未经证实并且带有误导性的。我不能因此责怪大多数的博主，因为在这个指南里的许多观点也还没有被广泛的发表在科学文献之外的地方。

本指南和许多的健身建议相矛盾，比如女性初期难以获得肌肉增长，锻炼休息时间应该在 1-3 分钟之间，你应该定期变换你的锻炼，通过机器练习不如哑铃有效等等。

在本指南中我会始终通过引用学术研究来支持我的观点，并且教你如何测量你的每周肌肉增长量以使你确定你的肌肉有所增长。

说到肌肉增长，一个刚入门的锻炼者在严格执行这个计划的情况下，在三个月内可以增长约 9 千克（20 磅）的肌肉（在此之后增长速度将大幅减缓）。每个人都可以做得到这一点，基因不好也并不会影响到你能否增长这 9 千克的肌肉，这是我们未来还要深入的问题。

除了做到了科学严谨，本指南同时也很全面，我不会只告诉你 75% 你想要知道的东西然后使你仍然心存疑问。为了使本指南成为完善的肌肉锻炼参考，我已经花了一年时间来调整这个营养和锻炼计划。

我们将会了解到关于这几个方面的内容：
> - 我们应该吃什么以使肌肉增长。
> - 什么是最好的锻炼计划。
> - 如何测量你的每周肌肉增长量。
> - 怎样克服瓶颈。

看到这里你应该已经心动了，如果你之前不想花上一两年的时间去体育馆锻炼出一身肌肉，那么恭喜你，现在你可以只用 3-4 个月达成这个目标。

再忍耐一下，我知道这听起来像是电视广告，但是你会对这个指南印象深刻的。如果你看完这个指南以后还是感到怀疑，你可以到我的 [Twitter](http://twitter.com/shapiro) 上来骂我傻瓜。

最后我要说明一下，这个指南是完全免费的。

## 关于作者

我是一个创业者也是一个工程师。 我的作品被展示在 [Forbes](http://www.forbes.com/sites/alextaub/2015/06/18/major-contributor-to-open-source-technologies-julian-shapiro-pulls-back-the-curtains-on-saas-usage/#7f882fc7985e) 上，我出过 [书](https://www.amazon.com/Web-Animation-using-JavaScript-Develop/dp/0134096665)，写过 [开源库](https://github.com/julianshapiro/velocity)，还 [开过](http://thenextweb.com/apps/2011/08/05/find-a-great-domain-name-for-your-startup-without-paying-the-earth-with-namelayer/#gref) 并且 [卖掉](http://venturebeat.com/2013/09/24/techstars-buys-namelayer-to-save-its-startups-from-awful-domain-names/) 了一家公司。

当我遇到一些对我有些困难但是能从中获益的事情的时候，我会尝试想办法让它变得对其他人而言更简单一些。这就是让我兴奋的事情。我用工程师的思维模式来思考其他的事情，我通过研究和自我实验，看看我是否能够揭开本质的组成部分。

然后我将它编成有说服力的故事来激励人们和我一起学习。

## 适用于每个人的健身意见

本指南涵盖了如何增长肌肉的普遍原则。

如果你是刚入门的锻炼者，你将会学到如何增长 9 千克（20 磅）的肌肉；如果你是中阶锻炼者，你将学会如何突破瓶颈；如果你打算变得更加强壮而不是更加庞大，本指南的 95% 都适用于你。

## 我能增长多少肌肉？

让我们来确定一个贴合实际的期望值以免完成训练以后感到失望，同时也通过每周的肌肉增长给你持续的锻炼动机。

首先选择你的性别以查看相应的内容：

[我是男性](#im-male)

[我是女性](#im-female)

### 我是男性

#### 男性身体范例

看看下面这个身材， [下载](../images/Male Body Target 1.jpg) 下来这张图片并且在你需要动力的时候看一眼:

![Male ideal physique](../images/Male%20Body%20Target%201.jpg)

这是一个对于平均体型男性可以在锻炼四个月后达到的效果。查尔斯看起来很健康，他的肌肉质量会让大多数女性喜欢，并且它不需要类固醇的帮助便能锻炼成这样。（如果你已经比这个例子更加强壮，我将会教你如何突破瓶颈变得更加强壮。）

**再重复一遍：任何没有疾病，年轻的成年男性在短短几个月的锻炼后都能在不需要类固醇的帮助下达到上图的水平。**

如果你从完全的脆弱的身子练起，三个月后你将会变成这样：

![Male mid-way ideal physique](../images/Male%20Part-way%20Body%20Target.jpg)

或者如果你已经比较强壮，你可以通过努力变得更加强壮：

![Male large ideal physique](../images/matt.jpg)

注：想要变得比上图明显强壮需要几年的锻炼，在几个月的锻炼后想要继续增长肌肉会变得更加困难，你不断增长的强壮肌肉需要不断增加的更高的刺激。当你进入这个阶段后，你每年大概会增长 0.9 千克（2 磅）的肌肉。

注意这上面的所有人都有少量的体脂，用于帮助转换为肌肉。事实上你并不会通过举重减少脂肪，因此减肥是另一件独立的事情。
如果你变强壮的目的是吸引女性，这里是一个可行性检测：大多数女性认为上图的身材比起健身杂志上的更加吸引人，这已经是定论了（[相关研究](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0050601), [相关研究](http://dfred.bol.ucla.edu/FrederickFesslerHaselton2005MuscularityInMagazines.pdf)）： 女性将拥有巨大的肌肉的男性比作化过多妆的女性，意思在于这有些太过头了。

换言之，女性更喜欢左边这幅图这样的。

![Male physique comparison](../images/What%20Women%20Want.jpg)

（还是不信？让你的女性朋友来投个票吧。）

因此如果你的目的是达到可以吸引女性的身材, 通过本指南**你只需要几个月时间就能实现**。 (但是回到之前提到的体脂问题，要知道女性还是会认为越低越好。)

#### 类固醇

Despite this reality check about women's tastes, you're probably still curious how some people — like Hollywood superheroes — get _huge_. Well, here's the truth: Most (if not all) celebrities playing superheroes [are or were at some point](http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/hollywood-steroid-use-a-list-609091) on [steroids](https://www.t-nation.com/steroids/steroids-what-pro-bodybuilders-are-really-using], [insulin][https://www.t-nation.com/diet-fat-loss/insulin-advantage), or [HGH](http://www.health.harvard.edu/diseases-and-conditions/growth-hormone-athletic-performance-and-aging) — the use of which can result in serious health issues. It is otherwise impossible to go from an average physique to [Thor Size](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLxEDaA9j2E#t=0m30s)™ in just a couple years.

So get celebrities out of your head as physique targets. You've been lied to.

A discussion of what is natural to attain should touch upon natural bodybuilding competitions, wherein contestants are not permitted to use steroids. Here are [some such contestants](http://www.bodybuilding.com/contest_media/6472/0/d/2008fitnessatlanticnovicelightweight671216831169.jpg). However, recognize that their muscles are accentuated by tans, vascularity, low body fat, and having done pushups right before walking onto the stage. Also notice how they have thick torsos and broad shoulders — these men are outliers with big frames. And, certainly, they've put in years of incredibly hard work.

But here's the more insidious aspect: "Natural" doesn't always mean you can't take other substances like HGH and insulin, which hugely benefit muscle growth. (You can read amateur breakdowns of cheating [here](https://www.t-nation.com/training/how-natural-is-natural-bodybuilding), [here](http://nattyornot.com/steroid-using-bodybuilders-pass-drug-tests/), and [here](http://nattyornot.com/bodybuilders-steroids-compete-natural-shows/). While not investigative, these reports present evidence for how easy it is to circumvent "natural" competitions.)

All of this is to once again hammer in that you must throw out the physique targets beat into you by pop culture and local gym rats if you want to build naturally.

What exactly do the results of steroids look like? Well, the model below has chest and shoulder muscles that are unnaturally large relative to his bone size. This relative size is not possible without artificial help. If your goal is to look like this or bigger, that's fine, but just know that you're not getting there naturally.

![Male unrealistic physique](../images/Male%20Body%20Unrealistic%20Target.jpg)

#### Male maximum muscle size

We still haven't answered the question of how big we can naturally get.

Check this out: Researcher [Casey Butt](http://www.weightrainer.net/index.html) performed a fascinating analysis on the muscle size of the world's top male bodybuilders ([source](http://www.weightrainer.net/potential.html), [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7496846)). He used data from the pre-steroid bodybuilding era, which means it reflects how muscular males can get naturally. We'll use his results to approximate the maximum size we can weigh at [10% body fat](https://paper.imgix.net/https%3A%2F%2Fd2mxuefqeaa7sj.cloudfront.net%2Fs_47BA25183F58123E5E1B386359348E6870986C628A36A91739F8545AFA7EFAAB_1468603592749_Male%2BPart-way%2BBody%2BTarget.jpg?auto=format&ixlib=js-0.2.1&s=8d542b39daff90e747952506b650c4a6).

I've turned Casey's formula into a calculator below. This is applicable to men only:

[Jump the Female Part](#julian-after-three-months)

### I'm female

#### Female physique examples

Here are two women with low body fat so you can clearly see their muscle size:

![Female thin physique](../images/Female%20Wrong%20Body%20Target.jpg)

![Female fit physique](../images/Female%20Body%20Target.jpg)

The first woman is thin (look at the frailness of her arms) and the second woman is fit. 

(By the way, if you're looking for more inspiration, see [here](https://www.instagram.com/achieving_balance/) and [here](https://www.instagram.com/blogilates/).)

Notice I’m not using the word “toned," which isn’t a thing. When a muscle is exercised, it responds by getting bigger, but it can’t stay the same size and just get harder. So when people use the word “toned," they’re referring to the combination of (1) being thin enough that muscle definition is visible and (2) having muscles to begin with.

You might not want to get as muscular as the second woman, but getting just halfway there will still make an enormous difference in your physique. 

If you only want to be muscular in a certain areas, this program provides a workout plan for only growing your arms (biceps and triceps), abs, butt (glutes), and hamstrings. Not sure what those are? The illustration below is applicable to both women and men:

![Human muscle diagram](../images/Anatomy.jpg)

#### Women gain muscle as fast as men

The limiting factor to how big you can get is the broadness of your skeleton ([study](http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/75/6/1012.long)). So if your body is on the smaller side (e.g. high school teenager), it will be impossible to reach the same maximum muscle mass as someone much bigger than you. In other words, the average woman will ultimately gain less muscle than the average man.

But this doesn't mean women reach their maximum muscle size at a slower rate. In fact, women develop muscle at the same rate as men ([study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11890579?dopt=Abstract), [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7558529), [study](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2991130/)). (Hat tip to [Menno Henselmans](http://bayesianbodybuilding.com/natural-muscular-potential-women/) for compiling this research.) The difference is that women start with less muscle mass on average and ultimately gain less.

> Even if you have an above-average sized frame, don’t be concerned about "accidentally" building lots of muscle overnight. You’ll notice muscle gains early enough in the process to avoid getting “bulky.” You will not turn into the Hulk.

Yes, men have more testosterone, but testosterone is less important to the female muscle development process. In fact, women benefit from higher levels of IGF1 growth hormone, which is critical to muscle growth, as compared to men ([study](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/49661582_Circulating_levels_of_IGF1_are_associated_with_muscle_strength_in_middle-aged-_and_oldest-old_women), [study](http://press.endocrine.org/doi/abs/10.1210/jcem.81.7.8675561)). 

While there are certainly fewer muscular women in the world, that’s a reflection of fewer women working to become very muscular — due to our societal expectations. It’s not a reflection of it being more difficult for women to actually build muscle. You may have a hard time believing all this, so click on any of those studies to skim the research. 

It’s important you understand that you're not at a disadvantage when bodybuilding because thinking otherwise can deter your progress. For example, one study examined the opposite scenario, where men were tricked into thinking they were taking steroids when they weren’t, and they consequently lifted 350% more in weight ([study](http://jamesclear.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/anabolic-steroids-the-physiological-effects-of-placebos.pdf), [study](http://www.ejmh.eu/mellekletek/2011_2_196_Berdi_etal.pdf))! This suggests your confidence in the gym plays a critical role in how much you can lift.

#### Getting a butt

No amount of aerobic activity, yoga, or calisthenics will build your butt ("glutes"). It's all about using heavy weight as per a proper bodybuilding program.

Specifically, the squat exercises you'll be doing are responsible for building glutes.

There's otherwise no secret to training glutes. They respond just like every other muscle — you exercise them with 8-10 reps and use heavier weight each workout.

## Julian after three months

Below are photos of me before working out and 90 days later. You can get significantly bigger than the 90 day mark by continuing the program for another 2–3 months. (After 5–6 months, however, you gain new muscle at about ~2lbs or 0.9kg per year.)

My arms went from 11" (28cm) unflexed to 13.5"(34cm). Inspiring for just 90 days.

## Get rid of your workout excuses

You know that cycle where you keep delaying a diet because you can’t stop saying to yourself, “Let me eat dessert tonight and I’ll officially start my diet tomorrow”? That cycle can happen with bodybuilding too.

Commit or don’t, but don’t lie to yourself.

Let's work through some of your potential concerns:

> - **Have a history of not following through?** Identify the person you respect most in life — someone who you don't want to think of you as a quitter. Tell them about your 90 day fitness goal and ask them to hold you to it. Create a calendar event for 3 months from now and include them in it.
> - **Too lazy to commute to the gym?** I'll explain how to work out from home.
> - **Concerned it’ll take too long?** Men only have to get to [this size](https://daks2k3a4ib2z.cloudfront.net/54a5a40be53a05f34703dd18/57939ede412fc21f2b6577b3_s_47BA25183F58123E5E1B386359348E6870986C628A36A91739F8545AFA7EFAAB_1468603190221_Male%2BBody%2BTarget%2B1.jpg) to be maximally attractive to women! It takes ~90 days. You do not have to get enormous.
> - **Have a hard time scheduling workouts?** Wake up an hour earlier than normal and work out in the mornings before your day kicks off.
> - **Don’t have the time?** Getting bigger only requires 1 hour three times a week. C'mon.
> - **Are you embarrassed to go to the gym?** Pay for a couple training lessons at your local gym so you can learn proper form.
> - **Afraid you don't have the talent?** Bodybuilding requires [zero talent](https://twitter.com/Shapiro/status/767431595112345600). You don't have to be an athlete whatsoever. If you can put food in your mouth and lift your groceries, you can lift weights. Human bodies are naturally wired for it.

> My favorite mind hack for gym motivation is only allowing myself to listen to my favorite bands and podcasts when I'm working out.

Don’t you want to finally be at a place where you wake up every morning, look in the mirror, and think, “I look pretty good.”? You're 90 days away from that. Go mark it in your calendar. Surprise all your friends with a big three-month transformation.

So stop procrastinating. Let's freaking do this.

Here's a final piece of motivation. Listen to the words spoken in this video:

## Guide overview

For as long as you want to continue gaining muscle, this program requires you to go to the gym three times per week for 45-60 minutes. Once you’ve reached your target size, you can switch to a maintenance plan of just two 40 minute sessions per week.

Here’s the breakdown of this guide:

**Prep Week**

> - Buy your workout accessories.
> - Take your starting photos.
> - Get into the habit of sleeping enough.

**Workouts**

> - First 2 months: Low-volume workouts with non-intimidating exercises anyone can do — even with only dumbbells. The workouts are 45 minutes long. You don’t have to push yourself hard yet because your unexercised muscles will respond quickly.
> - 2 months to infinity: This phase is for those who want to continue getting as big as possible. This plan consists of a higher volume and intensity of exercise, which will become necessary for your muscles to continue growing.

**After the following disclaimer, we can move onto the next section: Prep Week!**

## Continue to prep week

Prep week is the pre-workout phase that eases you into the bodybuilding lifestyle. By going through it, you're much less likely to quit on your bodybuilding goals.
